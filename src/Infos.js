                Conwayâ€™s Game of Life is based on a grid system.  Every individual location on the grid can be understood as a cell.  
                The game, or simulation, occurs over iterations, or generations.  After a generation, a cell may change from living or dead based on how many living or dead neighbors it had in a previous iteration.  
                A neighbor is any immediately adjacent spot on the grid (horizontal, vertical or diagonal).  We can understand this more clearly with an example and a clear demonstration of the rules.
